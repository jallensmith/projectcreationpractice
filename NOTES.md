### Step 1: Avenues for coming up with an idea:
    * What problem do you have in your everyday life that you would like to solve? (what to eat for dinner, etc)
    * What are you passionate about?

### Step 2: Working on the Overview
    * Brainstorm about what kind of features would like to have, write them down as you think of it, example:

    A user can fill out a form where you can create a recipe with instructions on how to create and ingredients added to the recipe. A user can list out the recipes and select the recipes they may want to like or comment on. A user can delete their own recipes and edit their own recipes
    
### Step 3: List out all of the features
    * Form to create recipe (submit, post) !
    -- make sure form is connected to the submit event (not the submit button)
    * List out recipes (DOMContentLoaded, get) !
    * A User can like a recipe (click, patch)
    * A user can comment on a recipe (submit, post)
    * A user can delete their recipe (click, delete) !
    * A user can edit their recipe (submit, patch) -- Stretch Goal (these our quality of life updates)
    * A user can search their recipe (submit) -- Stretch GOal 

### Step 4: Come up with an MVP - minimum viable product - the minimum or most basic functionality to meet the project requirements - if the user is left without something, then it is a MVP
    * Form to create recipe (submit)
    * List out recipes (DOMContentLoaded)
    * A user can delete their recipe (click)
    

### Step 5: Listing out your stretch goals (something to tackle after graduation, possibly)
    *(Base this on UI):
    * A user can edit their recipe (submit)
    * A user can search their recipe (submit)
    * A User can like a recipe (click)
    * A user can comment on a recipe (submit)

### Step 6: Plan out commits
Commit OFTEN! 
Form (commit) -> submit event (commit) -> list out new resources (commit)

(Things to bring to MVP pitch
------------------------------------
User stories
Drawn out models
Sketched out version of what frontend will look like
Evidence that you’re able to use the APIs and libraries that you’re going to implement
Proposal for what the MVP will look like)


### Other Requirements
3 Event Listeners (DOMContentLoaded, Click, Change, Submit, etc.)
Interactivity 
30+ Commits to Github (git add -> git commit -m)
Single HTML File
Use json server OR API (JSON is a stretch goal)

Notes: 
Git is a tool in the environment to set up our repository and talk to remote repositories (i.e. git hub, git lab)

*Keep main branch for project review
**stretch goals can go in branch
***new code
